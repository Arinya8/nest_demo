        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          The North Eastern Science and Technology Cluster — NESt — 
          was established in 2026 as a Government of India initiative 
          under the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MDoNER).
        </p>
        <p>
          Born from the recognition that the Northeast holds immense 
          untapped potential — in natural resources, traditional knowledge, 
          youthful energy, and ecological advantage — NESt was created 
          to convert that potential into tangible, measurable progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operating under the banner of the Viksit Purvottar Innovation 
          Centre, NESt is the region's first unified science, technology, 
          and entrepreneurship cluster — designed not just for research, 
          but for real-world impact across all eight states.

              technology, and knowledge-driven economic growth by 2047.

        <p>
          <strong>Viksit Bharat @ 2047</strong> — India's commitment to becoming a

          by science, technology, and inclusive growth.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>Viksit Purvottar</strong> — The regional expression of this vision, 
          ensuring that the Northeast is not left behind but instead 
          becomes a model for innovation-led development in India's 
          biodiversity-rich frontier states.
